# flask-tutorial

This repo was made for a homework in my class CS 178: Enginering Usable and Interactive Systems.

This project mainly follows the tutorial found here: https://www.python-engineer.com/posts/flask-todo-app/. Some deviations from the tutorial were needed to deal with more recent versions of Flask.
